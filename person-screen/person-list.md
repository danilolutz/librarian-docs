# Person List

The Person List screen works in a simple way: It is a screen where, when clicking on a line in the list, the system redirects to the [Person Details](person-details.md) screen.

This screen can be accessed by QuickSearch (`Ctrl+F`) and clicking on Person:

When clicking on the pencil icon, the system redirects to the [Person Editing](./) screen. It is worth mentioning that this screen also has a pagination feature.
